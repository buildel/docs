# Create first workflow

Learn how to work with workflows.

## Prerequisites

To create workflow, you must first have an organization set up in Buildel. If you haven't created one yet, please refer to our [previous guide](01-first-organization.mdx) on how to do so.

## Create a new workflow

If you haven't set up any workflows yet, you'll be greeted with the screen shown below. As you can see, you have a couple of choices: you can start a workflow from scratch or select one of our predefined [templates](/docs/category/templates).

To create a workflow from scratch, simply click on **Build a new AI workflow**. A sidebar will appear on the right with a field for the workflow name. Enter "My First Workflow" and then click submit.

Once you've successfully submitted, you'll be redirected to the main page of your workflow. Here, you can manage your workflow by adjusting its settings and more.

## Add our first blocks

On the right side, there's a sidebar displaying block categories. Buildel offers a variety of block types for numerous interesting functions.
Let's start with a basic workflow to see how straightforward it is. From the sidebar, select the [text-input](/docs/blocks/text-input.mdx) block and add it by clicking the **plus** icon or dragging it into your workflow board.

Repeat the process with the [text-output](/docs/blocks/text-output.mdx) block. Once added, we can connect the text-input and text-output blocks together to complete the setup.

In Buildel, blocks can have various input/output types. For now, you have to remember that you can connect blocks together only if their inputs/outputs shape is the same and the colors differ.

Now, you can initiate your workflow. Click the **Run** button, and if the label of the button changes to *Stop*, it means the workflow is properly configured and doesn't have any issues.

Additionally, you'll notice that the connection between blocks will start animating, indicating the flow of information from one block to another.

You can now input a value into the text-input block and click **Send**. The workflow will manage the connection between blocks and transmit the data to the text-output.
