# Knowledge Base

Let's add some "Knowledge" to our Workflow.

## Prerequisites

To move forward, you don't need to have a specific workflow ready, but to grasp the topic better, we strongly encourage you to follow along starting from our [previous guide](02-create-first-workflow.mdx).

## Why do we need a Knowledge Base?

As demonstrated in the previous guide, creating a simple AI chatbot isn't rocket science. But what happens when you want the chatbot to access additional data from which it can retrieve information and provide answers?

In other words, what if we aim to set up a Q/A (Question and Answer) workflow? For these types of workflows, we can utilize a Knowledge Base, where we upload files from which the chatbot can extract information and answer our questions.

## Add Document Search block

As you already know, Buildel provides many blocks for different purposes. One of the blocks that can utilize Knowledge Base is Document Search block.
