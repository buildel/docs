# Workflow Aliases

In this guide, you'll learn about aliases and how they can assist you in organizing your workflow history.

## Prerequisites

To move forward, you don't need to have a specific workflow ready, but to grasp the topic better, we strongly encourage you to follow along starting from our [previous guide](03-knowledge-base.mdx).

## What Aliases are?

In short, aliases act as a historical record of your workflow. You can preserve the current configuration by creating an alias for it. This allows you to modify or test your workflow without the fear of losing your setup.

## How to create an alias?

Creating an alias is quite straightforward. Let's say we want to save the configuration of our Knowledge Base workflow that we created in the [previous guide](03-knowledge-base.mdx).

<Video type="video/webm" src="/mdx-assets/guides/workflow-aliases/create-alias.webm"/>

To create an alias, all you need to do is click the *"Create alias"* button located in the top-right corner. This action will generate an alias from the current workflow configuration you have.

Now, you can easily switch to the *"latest"* alias and modify the configuration without any worries.

:::note

You can easily run the workflow using the alias, but you cannot change its configuration.

## How do you return to the configuration from the alias?

Imagine you've created an alias, then made some changes to the workflow, but now you've decided that those changes weren't a good idea and you want to revert to the Alias configuration.

It's also pretty straightforward...

<Video type="video/webm" src="/mdx-assets/guides/workflow-aliases/restore-alias.webm"/>

As you can see, after restoring the alias, the workflow's default configuration reverts back to the one from the alias.

If you no longer need an alias, you can easily remove it from the list.
