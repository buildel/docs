### Connect to our custom API

Ensure you replace the baseURL with our API's URL and include your API key as the bearer token in the Authorization header.

This setup will authenticate your requests and allow your chatbot to communicate with our API.

```tsx title="index.tsx"
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://buildel-api.fly.dev/api",
  defaultHeaders: { Authorization: 'Bearer ' + process.env.BUILDEL_API_KEY},
};

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." }],
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
});

console.log(completion.choices[0]);
```
