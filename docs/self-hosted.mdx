# Self-hosted

A getting started guide to self-hosting Buildel.

## Install

Buildel is designed to be self-hosted through Docker. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Buildel on your own server using Docker Compose.

:::tip

This guide uses Docker Compose example to simplify the process. In a production environment, you should consider a more advanced setup.
We recommend hosting Buildel on Fly.io as it works well with Elixir applications.

:::

To install Buildel, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
If you don't have them, you can install them by following the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Quick start

To get started, clone the [Buildel](https://github.com/elpassion/buildel) repository from GitHub.
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elpassion/buildel buildel
```

In the downloaded directory, navigate to the `self-hosting` folder. It contains:
- `docker-compose.yml` - the Docker Compose configuration file with all necessary services
- `init-database.sql` - the SQL script to initialize the database
- `postgresql.conf` - the PostgreSQL configuration file

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the `api` service, you'll see the `environment` section.
Let's generate the values for `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` variables and replace them in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
# SECRET_KEY_BASE
openssl rand -base64 48

# ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Now you can start the Buildel services using Docker Compose.

:::info

On the first run, you might need to comment out the `postgresql.conf` volume in the `docker-compose.yml` file to initialize the database.

:::

```bash
docker-compose up
```
