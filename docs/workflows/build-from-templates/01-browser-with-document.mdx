## Workflow setup

Let's create a workflow that uses browser to search for information and document search to store and retrieve browser results.

1. Drag and drop the required blocks to the canvas
2. Connect and configure the blocks as shown in the video below
3. Press **Run** button in top left corner

#### Chat system message:
```
You are a helpful assistant.

USE DOCUMENT SEARCH TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

ONLY IF YOU DO NOT FIND THE ANSWER, USE BROWSER TOOL.
```

<Video type="video/webm" src="/mdx-assets/workflows/templates/browser_with_document_07.webm"/>

## Usage

1. Type a question in the text input
2. The workflow will search for the answer in the knowledge base and if not found, it will use the browser to search for the answer.
3. The next time you ask similar question, the workflow will use the document search to retrieve the answer.
